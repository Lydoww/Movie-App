# 🎬 Movie-App - Movie Search Application

Movie-App is a simple React application for searching and filtering movies. Users can search for movies, filter by popularity or rating (Top/Flop), add movies to their favorites, and manage them from a dedicated page. The application uses `localStorage` to keep favorites even after the browser is closed.
