Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my personal work and skills using modern web technologies. The portfolio is built with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and optimized with Vite.

📦 Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
SASS: A powerful CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, nested rules, and mixins, enabling more efficient and maintainable stylesheets.

✨ Features
Dynamic Movie Search: Built with React, the application offers a dynamic search bar allowing users to easily find movies by title.
Top & Flop Filters: Users can filter movies based on ratings, sorting by the best (Top) or worst (Flop) films with a simple click.
Favorites Management: A "heart" button lets users add movies to their favorites, which are stored locally. Favorites can be viewed on a separate page, where they can also be removed.
Custom Styling with SASS: The application is styled using SASS, enabling modular, maintainable, and reusable styles throughout the project.

Local Storage: All user interactions, such as favorites, are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence without the need for a backend.
